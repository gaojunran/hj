# hj (Hyper Jujutsu)

> Working in Progress. ðŸš§

Fast, opinionated version control experience. Powered by [jj-vcs](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj).

## Goals

- Most of actions can be done with a single command, with reasonable default arguments.
- Try my best to make jj compatible with git remote actions (pull, push, ...). Some bookmark actions are trivial, I make them implicit.
- Final goal: make a freshman user able to use jj without any git knowledge.

MAKE **VERSION CONTROL** GREAT AGAIN!

## Planned Features

- [x] Commit Specified Files

  ```bash
  jj commit --interactive --message "Commit message"
  ```

- [x] Push to Remote
- [x] Pull from Remote

# hj (Hyper Jujutsu)

> Working in Progress. ðŸš§

Fast, opinionated version control experience. Powered by [jj-vcs](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj).

## Goals

- Most of actions can be done with a single command, with reasonable default arguments.
- Try my best to make jj compatible with git remote actions (pull, push, ...). Some bookmark actions are trivial, I make them implicit.
- Integrate GitHub workflow into jj, (powered by gh cli).
- Bring designable [starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt to jj.
- Final goal: make a freshman user able to use jj **without any git knowledge**.
